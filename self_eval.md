# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
This was probably the hardest excersise by far it required a lot of googling and youtubing. I unproductively struggled for 2 hours and became very frustrated and had to step away. Once I cleared my mind I was able to solve the problem. The most satisfying part was finally getting the solution. That made the journey worth it.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
The power of using methods allows us an insane amount of flexibility beacause if a method doesn't exist in ruby we can just make our own. I suspect this will be extremely useful.
